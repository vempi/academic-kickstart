abstract: 'Background: Polyvagal theory emphasizes that autonomic nervous system functioning
  plays a key role in social behavior and emotion. The theory predicts that psychiatric
  disorders of social dysfunction are associated with reduced heart rate variability,
  an index of autonomic control, as well as social inhibition and avoidance. The purpose
  of this study was to examine whether heart rate variability was reduced in treatment-seeking
  patients diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, a disorder characterized by social
  fear and avoidance.  Methods: Social anxiety patients (n = 53) were recruited prior
  to receiving psychological therapy. Healthy volunteers were recruited through the
  University of Sydney and the general community and were matched by gender and age
  (n = 53). Heart rate variability was assessed during a five-minute recording at
  rest, with participants completing a range of self-report clinical symptom measures.  Results:
  Compared to controls, participants with social anxiety exhibited significant reductions
  across a number of heart rate variability measures. Reductions in heart rate variability
  were observed in females with social anxiety, compared to female controls, and in
  patients taking psychotropic medication compared to non-medicated patients. Finally,
  within the clinical group, we observed significant associations between reduced
  heart rate variability and increased social interaction anxiety, psychological distress,
  and harmful alcohol use.  Conclusions: The results of this study confirm that social
  anxiety disorder is associated with reduced heart rate variability. Resting state
  heart rate variability may therefore be considered a marker for social approach-related
  motivation and capacity for social engagement. Additionally, heart rate variability
  may provide a useful biomarker to explain underlying difficulties with social approach,
  impaired stress regulation, and behavioral inhibition, especially in disorders associated
  with significant impairments in these domains.'
